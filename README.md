# MP's Enhanced Vanilla
This modpack focuses on optimazing Minecraft while giving it a nice new coat of paint without changing any of the core mechanics. You should be able to join any server with this modpack installed without issue. Due note that some servers don't like you joining with mods.

## State of Project
This modpack is relatively complete, but it's still in beta, because several mods cannot be added to the modpack due to stability reasons or the mods just being unfinished. This includes [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/uCdwusMi) and [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/mod/VSNURh3q).  
Do note that we do currently use [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/mod/VSNURh3q), however only on the server side.

### 1.20.2
As soon as all mods that are currently in use work for this version of Minecraft, we'll update.

## Other Repositories
[Packwiz Modded](https://github.com/MentoskaPraha/packwiz-modded) - modified version of packwiz used to create and maintain this modpack.
